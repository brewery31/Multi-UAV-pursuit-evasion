*OmniDrones* is an open-source platform designed for reinforcement learning research on multi-rotor drone systems. Built on [Nvidia Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html), *OmniDrones* features highly efficient and flxeible simulation that can be adopted for various research purposes. We also provide a suite of benchmark tasks and algorithm baselines to provide preliminary results for subsequent works.


## Installation

### 1. Isaac Sim

Download the [Omniverse Isaac Sim (local version/in the cloud version)](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) and install the desired Isaac Sim release **(version 2022.2.0)** following the [official document](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html). *Note that Omniverse Isaac Sim supports multi-user access, eliminating the need for repeated downloads and installations across different user accounts.*

Set the following environment variables to your ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc`` files :

```
# Isaac Sim root directory
export ISAACSIM_PATH="${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.0"
```

*(Currently we use isaac_sim-2022.2.0. Whether other versions can work or not is not guaranteed.)*

After adding the environment variable, apply the changes by running:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Conda

Although Isaac Sim comes with a built-in Python environment, we recommend using a seperate conda environment which is more flexible. We provide scripts to automate environment setup when activating/deactivating a conda environment at ``OmniDrones/conda_setup``.

```
conda create -n sim python=3.7
conda activate sim

# at OmniDrones/
cp -r conda_setup/etc $CONDA_PREFIX
# re-activate the environment
conda activate sim
# install OmniDrones
pip install -e .

# verification
python -c "from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp"
# which torch is being used
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__path__)"
```

### 3. Third Party Packages
OmniDrones requires specific versions of the `tensordict` and `torchrl` packages. For the ``deploy`` branch, it supports `tensordict` version 0.1.2+5e6205c and `torchrl` version 0.1.1+e39e701. 

We manage these two packages using Git submodules to ensure that the correct versions are used. To initialize and update the submodules, follow these steps:

Get the submodules:
```
# at OmniDrones/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Pip install these two packages respectively:
```
# at OmniDrones/
cd third_party/tensordict
pip install -e .
```
```
# at OmniDrones/
cd third_party/torchrl
pip install -e .
```
### 4. Verification
```
# at OmniDrones/
cd scripts
python train.py headless=true wandb.mode=disabled total_frames=50000 task=Hover
```

### 5. Working with VSCode

To enable features like linting and auto-completion with VSCode Python Extension, we need to let the extension recognize the extra paths we added during the setup process.

Create a file ``.vscode/settings.json`` at your workspace if it is not already there.

After activating the conda environment, run

```
printenv > .vscode/.python.env
``````

and edit ``.vscode/settings.json`` as:

```
{
    // ...
    "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/.python.env",
}
```
    
## Usage

For usage and more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://omnidrones.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Note that for this ``deploy`` branch, it currently supports following environments:

| Environment       | Single-agent or Multi-agent task |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Hover             | Single                           |
| Track             | Single                           |
| InvPendulumHover  | Single                           |
| InvPendulumTrack  | Single                           |
| PayloadTrack      | Single                           |
